Welcome to my carwash project.

Here are some steps you need to do before you can test the project:

1- run "composer install" command.
2- make .env file, and set the values.
3- run "php artisan key:generate" command to make the app key.
4- run "php artisan migrate --seed" command to make the tables and testing records in the database.
5- run "npm install" command.
6- run "npm run build" command.
7- run "php artisan serve" command

And you are good to go.
I hope you like my project :)
